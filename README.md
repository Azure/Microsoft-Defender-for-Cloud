Welcome to the Microsoft Defender for Cloud (formerly known as Azure Security Center) community repository. This repository contains:

- Security recommendations that are in private preview
- Programmatic remediation tools for security recommendations
- PowerShell scripts for programmatic management
- Azure Policy custom definitions for at-scale management of Microsoft Defender for Cloud
- Logic App templates that work with Defender for Cloud's Logic App connectors (to automate response to Security alerts and recommendations)
- Logic App templates that help you run regular tasks or reports within the scope of Microsoft Defender for Cloud
- Custom workbooks to visualize Defender for Cloud data

All of the above will help you work programmatically at scale with Microsoft Defender for Cloud and provide you additional value to secure your environment, some of which has not yet been embedded into the product (yet). You can submit any questions or requests [here](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Security-Center/issues).
