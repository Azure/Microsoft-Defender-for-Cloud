## Commit messages

When creating commits, always try to create useful commit messages explaining what that commit contains. Avoid commit messages like "fix" or "commit". If you're fixing something that's been reported as an issue in the repo, refer to the issue number in commit messages.

## Pull Requests

When creating a pull request, please create a good title, fill the description with content, and ideally, explain what your PR will change. Make sure to provide a [readme](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Security-Center/wiki/Readme.md-Template) file so people will know what your artifact will do. Once your pull request is submitted, we will automatically verify you've signed the CLA agreement, and that your code passes a set of CI build tests.
