### Exercise 1: CREATE AZURE API MANAGEMENT SERVICE

Note: The deployment time for a new Azure API Management service is ~ 1 hr.

1.	From the Azure portal menu, select **Create a resource**. You can also select Create a resource on the Azure Home page.
 ![](../Images/api1.png?raw=true)
2.  On the **Create a resource page**, select **Integration > API Management**.
![](../Images/api2.png?raw=true)
3.  In the Create API Management page, enter settings.

**Subscription**	The subscription under which this new service instance will be created.

**Resource group**	Create a new resource group and call it ‚Äúlabs-API‚Äù.

**Region**	North Europe

**Resource name**	API-Man-Service .net. 

**Organization name**	Contoso

**Administrator email**	Add your email address

**Pricing tier**	Select Developer tier 



4. Select **Review + create**.
5.	Once your API management service has been created after ~1 hour, then open it up in the Azure portal.


### Exercise 2: PUBLISH AN API WITHIN API MANAGEMENT

1.	In the left navigation of your API Management instance, select **APIs**.
 ![](../Images/api3.png?raw=true)
2.	Select the **OpenAPI** tile.
3.	In the Create from OpenAPI specification window, select **Full**.
4.	Enter the following values.
   You can set API values during creation or later by going to the **Settings** tab.

**OpenAPI specification**		https://petstore3.swagger.io/api/v3/openapi.json			

**Display name**	After you enter the OpenAPI specification URL, API Management fills out this field based on the JSON.		

**Name**	After you enter the preceding Display Name, API Management fills out this field based on the JSON.		

**API URL suffix**	petstore	

<img width="395" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e73849c1-eaae-419f-8d92-53e4f254b514" />
 
 5. Select **Create** to create your API.

### Test your API
You can call API operations directly from the Azure portal, which provides a convenient way to view and test the operations. In the portal's test console, by default, APIs are called by using a key from the built-in all-access subscription. You can also test API calls by using a subscription key scoped to a product.
1. In the left navigation of your API Management instance, select **APIs** > **Swagger Petstore.**

2. Select the **Test** tab, and then select **Finds Pets by status**. The page shows the status **Query parameter**. Select one of the available values, such as pending. You can also add query parameters and headers here.

In the **HTTP request** section, the **Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key** header is filled in automatically for you, which you can see if you select the "eye" icon.

3. Select **Send.**
   
<img width="423" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2018362c-6db7-4e9a-b20e-a8a5476d4fb9" />

4. The backend responds with **200 OK** and some data.

You can then scroll through the results to verify that the API has been onboarded successfully to Azure API Management.
 
Note: It will take up to 45 minutes for the API you just created to appear in Defender for Cloud for you to follow the next exercise.



### Exercise 3: ENABLE DEFENDER FOR API
1.	Go to the **Azure Portal (portal.azure.com)**. 
2.	Find the **Microsoft Defender for Cloud** blade and select **Environment settings** in the left-hand navigation bar. 
3.	Click the down arrow on Azure, through any management groups, and select the subscription you want to protect APIs on.
4.	Under Cloud Workload protections, ensure that the APIs plan is switched **On**.

### Exercise 4: ONBOARD APIS TO DEFENDER FOR APIS
Next, you will onboard that API to be protected by Defender for API.
1.	Navigate to the **Recommendations** pane in Microsoft Defender for Cloud
2.	Type "Defender for APIs" within the search box and select the recommendation **Azure API Management APIs should be onboarded to Defender for APIs**. 

<img width="940" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f3399538-9ef1-4770-ad18-88b9b2ce19ab">

 
3.	In the recommendation **Azure API Management APIs should be onboarded to Defender for APIs**, tick the box of the API labs-test and echo-api that you would like to onboard, and click **Fix**.


Note: Echo-api is an API that is created by default when you created the Azure API Management service, which is used for testing.


 ![](../Images/api9.png?raw=true)

4.	In the Fixing resources pane that appears, select **Fix 2 resources**. After a few minutes, you will receive a notification stating that the APIs have been onboarded.

Now you have protected those APIs with Microsoft Defender for API.




### Exercise 5: EXPLORE THE DEFENDER FOR API TILE AND LOOK AT API RECOMMENDATIONS IN DEFENDER FOR CLOUD
1.	Navigate to the Microsoft Defender for Cloud‚Äôs **Workload Protections** pane (from the left-hand navigation bar).

![](../Images/api23.png?raw=true)

11.	Select the **+** icon to start a new request. 

![](../Images/api24.png?raw=true)

12.	Using the HTTP request information that you copied in Step 6, enter the URL in **GET** (e.g., GET https://defenderapidemo.azure-api.net/echo/resource-cached?param1=sample) into Postman. 

![](../Images/api25.png?raw=true)
 
13.	Select the **Headers** tab. 

![](../Images/api26.png?raw=true)

14.	Enter the **APIM subscription key** as a **header**. 

**The key** Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key

**The value** the unique value that you copied in Step 8. 

15.	Enter another **header** for the user agent value. For this step, enter 

**The key** User-Agent

**The value** javascript: 


![](../Images/api27.png?raw=true)

16.	**Send** the request. You will get a **200 OK** status if the request went through. 

The user agent javascript: contains distinct patterns typical of script code and is rarely used by legitimate user agents.

After some time, Defender for APIs will trigger an alert with detailed information about this suspicious activity, as shown below:
