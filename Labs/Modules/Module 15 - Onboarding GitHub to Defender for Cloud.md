#### ðŸŽ“ Level: 200 (Intermediate)
#### âŒ› Estimated time to complete this lab: 30 minutes

## Objectives
In this exercise, you will learn how to create a GitHub Connector in Defender for Cloud.

### Exercise 1: Preparing the Environment

If you alredy finished [Module 1](https://github.com/Azure/Microsoft-Defender-for-Cloud/blob/main/Labs/Modules/Module-1-Preparing-the-Environment.md) of this lab, you can skip this exercise, otherwise plesae finish at least Exercise 1, 2 and 3 from Module 1.

### Exercise 2: Creating an GitHub Trial account

1.	Open an In-Private session in your web browser and navigate to [https://github.com/join](https://github.com/join)
2.	If this is the first time you're creating GitHub account, enter the UserName, Password and email address and follow the screen to create a new account 
3.	Type your Account email address and Password and login to your GitHub environment.

### Exercise 3: Obtain trial of GitHub Enterprise Cloud account
#### NOTE: GitHub Advanced Security is available for Enterprise accounts on GitHub Enterprise Cloud and GitHub Enterprise Server. Some features of GitHub Advanced Security are also available for public repositories on GitHub.com. For more information, see GitHubâ€™s products.

To setup trial of GitHub Enterprise Cloud, try the steps from this article. In order to setup GitHub Enterprise Server trial account, try the steps from this article.
For the purpose of this lab, weâ€™re setting up a trial to evaluate GitHub Enterprise Cloud. To get a Trial version of GitHub Enterprise Cloud, click [here](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/overview/setting-up-a-trial-of-github-enterprise-cloud). This will be a 30-day trial and you donâ€™t need to provide a payment method during the trial unless you add GitHub marketplace apps to your organization that require a payment method. 

Go ahead and create a new repository for the purpose of this lab, make the repository as â€˜Publicâ€™ for testing purposes in order to benefit from the GHAS features.

  security:
    runs-on: windows-latest
    continue-on-error: false
    strategy:
      fail-fast: true
      
    steps:

    - name: Run Microsoft Security DevOps
      uses: microsoft/security-devops-action@preview
      continue-on-error: false
      id: msdo

    - name: Upload alerts to Security tab
      uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v2
      with:
