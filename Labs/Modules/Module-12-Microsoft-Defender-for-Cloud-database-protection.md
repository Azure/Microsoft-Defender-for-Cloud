## Objectives

This exercise guides you MDC's database protection plans. Database protection in Defender for Cloud contains four flavors, dependong on which database type you are looking to protect.

1. Defender for SQL PaaS (SQL on Azure VM)
Vulnerability assessment and threat protection is available for this plan. Read more about it [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-sql-introduction).
2. Defender for SQL on machines (SQL servers hosted on premise, in Azure, AWS or GCP)
For this plan, Azure Monitoring Agent (AMA) is required, in place of Microsoft Monitoring Agent (MMA). Read more about this [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-sql-usage). Vulnerability assessment and detecting anomalous activities are available to protect your Iaas SQL Servers.
3. Defendr for Open-source relational database
Protect your PostgreSQL, MySQL and MariaDB resources by detecting anomalous activities. Read more about these security alerts [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-databases-introduction).
4. Defender for Cosmos DB (NoSQL)
Detect potential threats against Cosmos DB accounts like SQL injection, compromised identities or potential exploitation. Read more about CosmosDB protection [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/concept-defender-for-cosmos).
