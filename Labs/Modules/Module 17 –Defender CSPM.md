 ## Use-case for the exercise

A hypothetical organization, "Adatum Corporation," had a robust cybersecurity infrastructure in place. However, one day, an attacker used a brute force or password spraying attack to gain access to an Internet-exposed server of the organization.

The attacker could quickly move laterally through the network, exploiting vulnerabilities on the Internet-exposed servers and gaining access to the organization's Storage Accounts, SQL servers, and Key Vaults. The SOC department was alerted by Defender for Cloud on the ‚ÄúBrute Force, Password Spray‚Äù IOC/IOA, and quickly realized something was wrong when they noticed unusual activity on the servers and Storage Accounts.

In response to the attack, the security engineers leveraged the attack path analysis to identify the entry point of the attack and the path the attackers used to move laterally through the network. Based on this analysis, they were able to close the entry point and cut off the attackers' access to the organization's data.

Additionally, they utilized **Sensitive Data Discovery** to identify and secure sensitive information that could be at risk of exposure. **Permission Management** tools were implemented to review and tighten access controls, ensuring that permissions were strictly granted based on the principle of least privilege. The discovery of plaintext secrets in the environment prompted the integration of **Secret Discovery** tools to encrypt sensitive data and manage secrets more securely.

The IT department didn't stop there. They also took a proactive approach by implementing security recommendations to fix the vulnerabilities on the Internet-exposed servers and prevent similar attacks in the future. Utilizing the Risk Prioritization feature of DCSPM, the security team gained full visibility into which recommendations should be prioritized, focusing their efforts on addressing the most critical vulnerabilities first. Additionally, they implemented a robust incident response plan and conducted regular security training for employees. 

Thanks to the combination of both reactive and proactive measures, Adatum Corporation was able to prevent a major data breach and keep their sensitive information safe. This hypothetical use case demonstrates the importance of having both a reactive and proactive approach when it comes to cybersecurity, including performing attack path and security risk analysis, implementing security recommendations, assigning/managing change actions to the proper owners, and educating employees to prevent future attacks.  

## Exercise 3: Analyzing and Mitigating Attack Paths

In this exercise, we will explore the Attack Path feature of Defender CSPM. Through a hands-on scenario, you will learn how to identify and mitigate potential security breaches that exploit critical vulnerabilities and inadequate permission settings in cloud environments.

### Scenario Overview

An Internet-exposed VM has been identified with High severity vulnerabilities, which includes read permissions to a key vault. This setup poses a significant risk as it may allow attackers to exploit Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerabilities on the server. The lack of "least privileged" permission configurations could enable intruders to access sensitive secrets stored in the Key Vault once the server is breached.

### Objective

Utilize the Attack Path feature to trace and understand how an attacker could navigate through your cloud environment and identify critical steps to mitigate this risk.

The next exercise will demonstrate how to leverage the Attack Path feature of Defender for CSPM, highlighting a critical use case where an Internet-exposed VM with High severity vulnerabilities and read permissions to a key vault presents a potential attack vector.
